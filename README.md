Neniri
================

A simple ticketing system based on the PHP framework Neos Flow.
Customers create tickets that are prepared graphically and functionally for internal processing.

With Neniri you create projects to which you can assign incoming tickets. Tickets can be assigned to user accounts. There is also an option to connect Git to created projects.

See the feature list to get an overview about the posibillities or just check the demo.
